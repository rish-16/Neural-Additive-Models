# Neural-Additive-Models
TensorFlow 2.0 implementation of Neural Additive Models 

---

Tried to implement the model from [Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13912) written by Rishabh Agarwal, Nicholas Frosst, Xuezhou Zhang, Rich Caruana, and Geoffrey Hinton. The model is written in `TensorFlow v2.2.0`
